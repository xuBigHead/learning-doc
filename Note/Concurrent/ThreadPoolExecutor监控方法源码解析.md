### 获取线程池已执行和未执行的任务总数
> java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor
```java
public class ThreadPoolExecutor extends AbstractExecutorService {

     * Returns the approximate total number of tasks that have ever been
     * scheduled for execution. Because the states of tasks and
     * threads may change dynamically during computation, the returned
     * value is only an approximation.

### 获取线程池当前的线程数量

        } finally {
            mainLock.unlock();
        }

### 获取线程池核心线程数
> java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor
```java
public class ThreadPoolExecutor extends AbstractExecutorService {

     * Returns the core number of threads.
     *
     * @return the core number of threads
     * @see #setCorePoolSize
     */

### 获取当前线程池中正在执行任务的线程数量
> java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor
```java
public class ThreadPoolExecutor extends AbstractExecutorService {

     * Returns the approximate number of threads that are actively
     * executing tasks.
     *
     * @return the number of threads
